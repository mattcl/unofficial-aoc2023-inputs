# Unofficial AoC 2023 Inputs

These inputs were were independently randomly generated with the goal of
creating a pool of "admissible" extra inputs for Advent of Code 2023.

For an input to be included here, N of M different implementations needed to
agree on the solutions. While these inputs might not be exactly like the
official ones (I'd have no way of generating "real" inputs not having access to
the real code), they should be acceptable according to the problem
specifications.

For days whose inputs required special properties, those special properties have
been (mostly) replicated here.

The generator is [here](https://github.com/mattcl/challengr/tree/master/examples/aoc2023).

## Note about day 24's inputs:

This problem, because it involves floating point, is likely to have the most
variance between computed solutions and real solutions. For the most part, the
selected inputs were nice enough to be solved by LU/QR decomp, as well as with
sympy for python.
